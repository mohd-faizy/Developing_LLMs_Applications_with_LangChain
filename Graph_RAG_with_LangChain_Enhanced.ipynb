    "Vector-based RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems combine **vector similarity search** with **generative models** (like GPT) to improve response accuracy by fetching relevant information from a knowledge base. While powerful, **Vector RAG has several limitations**, especially in real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Semantic Drift or Irrelevant Retrieval**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Vector search retrieves documents based on *semantic similarity*, not factual accuracy or context relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "Suppose a user asks:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"What are the side effects of metformin?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The system may retrieve chunks containing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"The benefits of metformin in managing blood sugar\"\n",
    "* \"Metformin's role in preventing diabetes complications\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue:** These are related **semantically**, but they may **not directly mention side effects**. The model may then hallucinate or guess side effects, leading to unreliable answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Loss of Granularity**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** When documents are chunked too large or too small, RAG systems struggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "A 20-page medical paper is chunked into 1-page chunks. The user's query:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"What did the clinical trial say about metformin and weight loss?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If the specific trial is mentioned briefly in just one paragraph, vector search may **miss it** if:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Chunk is too broad and dilutes relevance\n",
    "* Embedding doesn't capture that fine-grained detail\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. No True Understanding of Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Vector similarity is context-agnostic ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt consider previous turns in a conversation unless explicitly added.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "**Conversation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* User: \"Tell me about Python decorators.\"\n",
    "* Then: \"What about their use in Flask?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector search may **not know what \"their\" refers to**, unless conversation history is added to the query, which RAG doesn‚Äôt do natively.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Stale or Outdated Knowledge**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Vector RAG systems are only as up-to-date as their vector store.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "User asks:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"What's the latest security patch in Log4j?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If the vector DB was last updated in 2022, it might **miss 2024 disclosures**, leading to outdated or dangerous information.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Embedding Quality and Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Embeddings might not capture important domain-specific nuances.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "For a legal query like:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"What precedent did the judge rely on in Roe v. Wade?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Legal documents may contain dense citations and context-specific phrases. General-purpose embeddings may not **capture the key precedent accurately**, resulting in **weak or unrelated chunks** being retrieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Long Documents, Poor Chunking**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Poor chunking strategies lead to missed context or cutoff info.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "In a user manual, the definition of \"safe operating temperature\" might be split across two chunks. The RAG system may retrieve only half of the definition, leading the model to guess or produce partial info.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **7. Lack of Ranking or Reranking**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Vector RAG might retrieve the *top k* most similar documents but **not the most useful or trustworthy** ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"What causes high CPU usage in Kubernetes?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The top vector match might describe CPU metrics collection, while a lower-ranked chunk (ignored) contains the **actual explanation** for common CPU issues (e.g., liveness probes, throttling, etc.).\n",
