    "## 🧠 I. Short Answer Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. What is a Knowledge Graph, and what three main components does it use to represent information?**\n",
    "A Knowledge Graph is a semantic network representing relationships among real-world entities. Its three key components are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Nodes** (entities)\n",
    "* **Edges** (relationships)\n",
    "* **Labels** (categories for nodes)\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Explain the purpose of \"nodes\" and \"edges\" within a Knowledge Graph.**\n",
    "Nodes represent distinct entities such as people, places, or concepts. Edges connect these nodes and define how the entities are related to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. How does Named Entity Recognition (NER) relate to the creation of Knowledge Graphs?**\n",
    "NER identifies specific entities (like names, places, and organizations) from unstructured text. These entities become nodes, and their detected connections form the edges in a Knowledge Graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Describe the primary difference between keyword search and semantic search in the context of retrieval.**\n",
    "Keyword search looks for exact matches of words, often missing context. Semantic search interprets the meaning of words to find conceptually related information, even if exact terms differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. What is \"hybrid search\" and why is it considered more effective than keyword or semantic search alone?**\n",
    "Hybrid search combines keyword and semantic search. It improves accuracy by using precise term matching and contextual understanding together for better information retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. List three key differences between a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) and a Graph Database.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Structure**: RDBMS uses tables; GraphDB uses nodes and edges.\n",
    "* **Query Language**: RDBMS uses SQL; GraphDB uses Cypher.\n",
    "* **Relationship Handling**: RDBMS uses joins; GraphDB natively models relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. What is the main advantage of using Cipher Query Language in Neo4j compared to SQL in RDBMS for complex queries?**\n",
    "Cypher allows intuitive and visual querying of data relationships, eliminating complex joins and nested queries typically required in SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Explain what \"properties\" and \"labels\" signify when defining elements within a Neo4j Property Graph Data Model.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Properties**: Key-value pairs storing metadata about nodes or relationships (e.g., name, year).\n",
    "* **Labels**: Tags that categorize nodes into types like \"Movie\" or \"Person.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. How does LangChain's LLMGraphTransformer facilitate the creation of a graph document from raw text?**\n",
    "It uses an LLM to process raw text, extract entities and relationships, and convert them into structured graph elements automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. Describe the function of the GraphCypherQAChain in LangChain for querying a graph database.**\n",
    "It converts natural language questions into Cypher queries, runs them on a graph database, and returns the result as a human-readable answer.\n",

    "## 📝 III. Essay Format Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Information Retrieval Evolution**\n",
    "   Discuss how search evolved from basic keyword methods to hybrid search powered by semantic understanding and Knowledge Graphs. Highlight LLMs’ role in enabling deep context awareness and enhancing response quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **RDBMS vs. GraphDB Models**\n",
    "   Compare data structure (tables vs. nodes), relationship modeling, and query languages (SQL vs. Cypher). Provide examples like social networks or movie recommendation systems where GraphDB excels.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Unstructured to Graph Pipeline**\n",
    "   Explain steps: document chunking → embedding/vectorization → entity extraction (NER) → relationship detection → graph creation (e.g., with Neo4j). Address challenges like ambiguity and benefit of structured insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **LangChain’s Role in RAG Apps**\n",
    "   Break down how LangChain components like `LLMGraphTransformer` and `GraphCypherQAChain` enable intelligent data interaction. Discuss how this enhances the performance and usability of RAG systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Designing a Movie Recommendation System Using Knowledge Graphs**\n",
    "   Define graph structure: nodes = movies, directors, actors; relationships = ACTED\\_IN, DIRECTED. Use Cypher to find \"similar movies\" based on shared genre, cast, director, or user preferences.\n",
