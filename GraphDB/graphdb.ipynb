    "## üß† I. Short Answer Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. What is a Knowledge Graph, and what three main components does it use to represent information?**\n",
    "A Knowledge Graph is a semantic network representing relationships among real-world entities. Its three key components are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Nodes** (entities)\n",
    "* **Edges** (relationships)\n",
    "* **Labels** (categories for nodes)\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Explain the purpose of \"nodes\" and \"edges\" within a Knowledge Graph.**\n",
    "Nodes represent distinct entities such as people, places, or concepts. Edges connect these nodes and define how the entities are related to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. How does Named Entity Recognition (NER) relate to the creation of Knowledge Graphs?**\n",
    "NER identifies specific entities (like names, places, and organizations) from unstructured text. These entities become nodes, and their detected connections form the edges in a Knowledge Graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Describe the primary difference between keyword search and semantic search in the context of retrieval.**\n",
    "Keyword search looks for exact matches of words, often missing context. Semantic search interprets the meaning of words to find conceptually related information, even if exact terms differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. What is \"hybrid search\" and why is it considered more effective than keyword or semantic search alone?**\n",
    "Hybrid search combines keyword and semantic search. It improves accuracy by using precise term matching and contextual understanding together for better information retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. List three key differences between a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) and a Graph Database.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Structure**: RDBMS uses tables; GraphDB uses nodes and edges.\n",
    "* **Query Language**: RDBMS uses SQL; GraphDB uses Cypher.\n",
    "* **Relationship Handling**: RDBMS uses joins; GraphDB natively models relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. What is the main advantage of using Cipher Query Language in Neo4j compared to SQL in RDBMS for complex queries?**\n",
    "Cypher allows intuitive and visual querying of data relationships, eliminating complex joins and nested queries typically required in SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Explain what \"properties\" and \"labels\" signify when defining elements within a Neo4j Property Graph Data Model.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Properties**: Key-value pairs storing metadata about nodes or relationships (e.g., name, year).\n",
    "* **Labels**: Tags that categorize nodes into types like \"Movie\" or \"Person.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. How does LangChain's LLMGraphTransformer facilitate the creation of a graph document from raw text?**\n",
    "It uses an LLM to process raw text, extract entities and relationships, and convert them into structured graph elements automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. Describe the function of the GraphCypherQAChain in LangChain for querying a graph database.**\n",
    "It converts natural language questions into Cypher queries, runs them on a graph database, and returns the result as a human-readable answer.\n",
